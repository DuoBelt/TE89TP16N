# TE89TP16N

A snippets that allows you to remotely control TE89TP16N featured devices by an Arduino with some cheap Chineese RF 433MHz transmitter/receiver.

Used to receive and send to Anslut RC Sockets from Jula.

This is some raw, experimental code. It is not elegant nor encapsulated in a class. But it works and works fine ;)
